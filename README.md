# @query/schema

This lib provides a querystring-safe format with a syntax that maps coherently to JSON Schema. This allows for a concise notation for defining filters and projections over various collections, and makes it possible to add the capability of arbitrarily complex querying over any JSON stream.

### Basic queries

Simple queries look something like this:

```js
qss.parse('?name=The+Big+Lebowski;year=1998')
```

This parses to a JSON Schema that can be used to records in a given indexed collection. The resulting (v5) JSON Schema should look something like this:

```js
{
  properties: {
    name: {
      constant: 'The Big Lebowski'
    },
    year: {
      constant: '1998'
    }
  }
}
```

Note how the `+` character decodes to a space per the standard `x-www-form-urlencoded` behavior.

NB: the actual JSON Schema that's output is a bit less pleasant (we still need to do some term rewriting to us to CNF, or close to it.)


### Nested properties

Nested properties can also be specified as paths in a schema string using the `/` delimiter:

```js
qss.parse('?year=2003;director/firstName=Quentin')
```

The resulting parsed query object:

```js
{
  properties: {
    director: {
      properties: {
        firstName: {
          constant: 'Quentin'
        }
      }
    },
    year: {
      constant: '2003'
    }
  }
}
```


### Property constraints

Property constraints are values set at the schema level, which is done using the `:` delimiter in property paths:

```js
qss.parse('?director/firstName=Quentin;year:gte=2003')
```

The resulting JSON Schema:

```js
{
  properties: {
    director: {
      properties: {
        firstName: {
          constant: 'Quentin'
        }
      }
    },
    year: {
      gte: '2003'
    }
  }
}
```

The above output isn't *quite* JSON Schema as is: note the `gte` keyword where the schema for the `year` property. This is one of a handful of custom schema keywords defined as macros for convenience.

The resulting JSON Schema, after expanding the `gte` macro:

```js
{
  properties: {
    director: {
      properties: {
        firstName: {
          constant: 'Quentin'
        }
      }
    },
    year: {
      formatMinimum: '2003',
      formatMinimumExclusive: false
    }
  }
}
```

This schema should work in any v5 JSON Schema validator.


### Schema keyword macros

#### `lt`, `gt`, `lte`, `gte`

The standard `ltgt` options are defined as schema macros which transform into the JSON Schema (v5) `format*` keywords with appropriate values. For instance the `gte` macro is defined like this:

```js
ajv.addKeyword('gt', {
  macro: function (schema, parentSchema) {
    return {
      formatMinimum: schema,
      formatMinimumExclusive: true
    }
  }
})
```

#### `eq`, `ne`

A macro is also defined for the `eq` keyword, aliasing the `constant` keyword:

```js
ajv.addKeyword('eq', {
  macro: function (schema, parentSchema) {
    return { constant: schema }
  }
})
```

The `ne` macro is also defined, based on the `eq` macro and the standard JSON Schema `not` keyword:

```js
ajv.addKeyword('ne', {
  macro: function (schema, parentSchema) {
    return { not: { eq: schema } }
  }
})
```

#### `size`

The `size` macro is defined to expand into the standard JSON Schema `*Length` keywords. The `size` of both strings and arrays can be asserted, as well as the total number of object keys, using this one macro:

```js
ajv.addKeyword('size', {
  macro: function (schema, parentSchema) {
    return {
      minLength: schema,
      maxLength: schema,
      minItems: schema,
      maxItems: schema,
      minProperties: schema,
      maxProperties: schema
    }
  }
})
```


### Key constraints

A stream of "index" records (e.g. level's `createReadStream`) is a sequence of objects containing `key` and `value` fields. By default query paths target the `value` keys, but this may not always be what you want. There are times where you may want to reference the `key` field, e.g. if this data isn't contained in the `value` record, or to constrain the resulting stream by some `ltgt` range on the keys.

To set constraints on `key` fields, or other more general constraints, use a property path which begins with the string `:`:

```js
qss.parse('?:key:gte=a;:key:lt=n;year:gt=2003')
```

```js
{
  key: {
    gt: 'a',
    lt: 'b'
  },
  properties: {
    year: {
      gt: '2003'
    }
  }
}
```


### Type/format enforcement

The `type` keyword can be used to filter properties by type. For example, if property `name` could be a string or an object, you could target only `string`-typed names with this query:

```js
qss.parse('?name:type=string')
```

This results in the value schema (the JSON Schema describing the `value` records):

```js
{
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: 'string'
    }
  }
}
```
You can also restrict a query to values matching a given format:

```js
qss.parse('?year:format=year')
```

This schema should filter out any records with date values which don't adhere to the standard JSON Schema 'year' format:

```js
{
  properties: {
    name: {
      format: 'year'
    }
  }
}
```

You could even define custom formats for added flexibility:

```js
qss.parse('?version:format=semver;dependencies:additionalProperties:format=semver-range')
```

For example if you were validating a stream of `package.json` sources, this query would filter out records with an invalid semver `version` or `dependencies` with invalid `semver-range` values:

```js
{
  properties: {
    version: {
      format: 'semver'
    },
    dependencies: {
      additionalProperties: {
        format: 'semver-range'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Simple union types can also be specified with an array:

```js
qss.parse('?name:type=(string,integer,boolean)')
```

The resulting value schema:

```js
{
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: [ 'string', 'integer', 'boolean' ]
    }
  }
}
```


### Logical Connectives

Complex union types can be specified with comma-separated union clauses:

```js
qss.parse('?name:type=string,(name:type=integer;name:minimum=10),name:type=boolean')
```

Like just about anything else, this can also be constructed by specifying the appropriate JSON Schema structure directly:

```js
qss.parse('?name:anyOf=((:type=string),(:type=integer;:minimum=10),(:type=boolean))')
```

Concise forms are available for the other logical relations, as well as syntax sugar for negation and enumeration, where it aids legibility.


**NB: see tests for more syntax and usage examples**


### Default values

TODO


## Stream filters

```js
var queryStream = require('@query/schema/filter')(db)

queryStream('year:gt=2003').on('data', function (data) {
  // for all records:
  //  data.value.year > '2003'
})
```

You can also provide a base schema when wrapping the underlying level instance, and the appropriate hooks will be added to validate all writes against this schema.
